## Description

Acme Insurance Company sells auto insurance directly to consumers via Vertical Search websites. On these websites, consumers who are already shopping for auto insurance enter some information about themselves and then are shown ads from insurance companies. Each ad shown is called an "impression" and each record in this table represents one ad impression.

These ads are shown based on an online auction where insurance companies bid to have their ad shown, and the ads are shown in order based on the highest bid amount. The insurance companies only pay if their ad is clicked on, but bidding higher will cause the ad to be shown higher in the ranking and is more likely to be clicked on if it is in a higher position.

Acme currently bids $10 for all customers, but is able to set different bid prices for different types of customers. For example, Acme could bid $10 for all customers with 1 vehicle and $12 for all customers with 2 vehicles. 

- Acme would like to come up with a bidding strategy which optimizes the cost per customer acquired while ensuring that for every 10,000 ads shown they are expected to acquire at least 400 customers. How should Acme set prices by customers segment?
- The channel manager who buys advertising on this vertical search website would also like to know if in the course of your analysis you come across any other interesting findings!
